 Hello! My name is Philippa, but most people call me Pip or Pippa :) I am from Nottingham, England but I am living in **Santander, Spain**. 

##  My history
 
 I have been teaching for over a decade across 4 different countries (England, France, The Netherlands and Spain). I also have a lot of experience learning languages myself! 

 I received my undergraduate and masterâ€™s degree from Cambridge University specialising in English and Education Studies. I also have a PGCE and CELTA certification. 

 I have a lot of experience working with businesses, adults, teenagers and children. I have taught exam preparation course for Cambridge, APTIS and IELTS with high success rates. I have taught students from level A2 until C2 level. 

 I love teaching because I truly enjoy meeting new people and helping them to achieve their goals and improve their English. 

## My Methodology 
 
 I believe learning a language can be fun, exciting but also challenging. The most important factor when learning is feeling comfortable and confident so that you can ask questions and make mistakes and improve all the time. 

 When we first meet we will set goals together and discuss the best learning method for you - because we are all different. Perhaps you will learn more with songs, role-plays, games, conversations or traditional exam exercises - we can discover what works the best for you together!
