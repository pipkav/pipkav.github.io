## Timetables

I understand that my students often have very busy lives, therefore I am very flexible and we can arrange your English classes around your other work, study or family commitments. 

I am available from 9am - 9pm Monday - Thursday, and 10am - 2pm Fridays (including lunch times). 

If you cannot commit to the same day or hour each week, don’t worry we can work together to find a flexible timetable that will work for you! Get in touch today to organise your perfect schedule. 


## Cancellations 

Life is full of changes, so if you need to cancel a class, don’t worry, contact me 24 hours before the class to let me know and we can rearrange for another day with no charge. Cancellations on the day of the class may be charged.
