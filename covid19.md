Staying safe and healthy is alway my priority for me and my students. 

I am fully vaccinated against Covid-19. 

At my house I have a large terrace where we can have our classes outside. If you feel comfortable inside, the windows are open all the time for good ventilation and if you prefer we can wear masks during class too. 

Donâ€™t forget online classes are always available if you are feeling unwell or want to feel more secure.
