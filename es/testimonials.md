Puedes leer lo que algunos de mis estudiantes actuales y antiguos tienen que decir:

> Pip was recommended to me for my English classes and it is the best
decision I have ever made. Her classes are very practical, and she adapts
to all my needs in order to improve in the areas I need. In addition to
being a great professional, her passion for her profession and charisma
make the classes very enjoyable and fun.
I hadn't studied English for a long time, and now, in addition to having
improved the theory, I feel much more confident and very fluent in
practice. I recommend Pip 100%, she has helped me a lot in preparing for
English exams, and in having the agility I needed to hold conversations in
that language very quickly and efficiently. Thanks for your great help, the
best teacher ever. :) -- **Marta Vega Campos**

> Pip has made sure that I am less insecure when I speak English. The classes
are challenging and Pip creates a relaxed atmosphere. I learned a lot from
it. -- **Ilona Mijnders**

> We did an English course with a little group of colleagues. Every week we
really looked forward to being in class with Pip.
Her way of teaching is so natural and enjoyable, she also is funny and
light in her teaching style.
So we didn't consider it to be a tough class, but I got my C1 level, in a
real playful way! - **Marjan de Smit**
