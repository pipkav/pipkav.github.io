Leer lo que unos de mis estudiantes actuales y antiguos dice:


> Really good English classes, Pippa adapts the lesson to exactly what you
need. She's so nice and it's easy to learn and to improve your English
level with her. -- **Daniel Molina**

> Pip was recommended to me for my English classes and it is the best
decision I have ever made. Her classes are very practical, and she adapts
to all my needs in order to improve in the areas I need. In addition to
being a great professional, her passion for her profession and charisma
make the classes very enjoyable and fun.
I hadn't studied English for a long time, and now, in addition to having
improved the theory, I feel much more confident and very fluent in
practice. I recommend Pip 100%, she has helped me a lot in preparing for
English exams, and in having the agility I needed to hold conversations in
that language very quickly and efficiently. Thanks for your great help, the
best teacher ever. :) -- **Marta Vega Campos**

> She has been helping me for two years to get a proficient English level.
She was patient, kind, friendly and she worked on my weak points to make me
a better student.  She also was very attentive, and she showed interest in
my hobbies, activities, and my job.  I really loved her classes and I
totally recommend her to anyone. She is the best. -- **Adriana Calvo Viota**

> English classes with Philippa were very fruitful, I learnt a lot without
realizing it, sometimes I even forgot that I was in class. Although I was
her student during a short period of time, I can say without a doubt that
she is the best English teacher I've ever had. -- **Kristel Romero Monserrate**

> Pip has made sure that I am less insecure when I speak English. The classes
are challenging and Pip creates a relaxed atmosphere. I learned a lot from
it. -- **Ilona Mijnders**

> Pippa was a really nice teacher, she understood perfectly what I needed and
I was very happy learning with her. Her way of teaching was really
interesting, using nice games and tricks to catch up my attention. I loved
her lessons, there were really productive and motivating. -- **Lucia Barca**

> We did an English course with a little group of colleagues. Every week we
really looked forward to being in class with Pip.
Her way of teaching is so natural and enjoyable, she also is funny and
light in her teaching style.
So we didn't consider it to be a tough class, but I got my C1 level, in a
real playful way! - **Marjan de Smit**

> Pippa is a great teacher. Not only will you learn quickly and
effectively, but you will have fun in her classes. Moreover, she is a very
thoughtful person who cares about her students. I recommend attending her
classes if you want to improve your English and pass a particular exam. -- **Victor Diaz Palacios**

> The classes with Pippa were very enriching. As a teacher, she is extremely
professional, close, and adapts greatly to the needs of the students.
Thanks to her, I not only improved my level of English and managed to pass
the Cambridge Proficiency exam but she also helped me to gain confidence in
myself and my own level of English. I would definitely attend classes with
her again. -- **Irene CalderÃ³n**

> Pip is a kind and committed teacher. She cares that no one was left behind
in class, she gets the objetives we need and encourages a lot with the
practice of english. I totally recommended her! Great professional! -- **Beatriz Gomez**
