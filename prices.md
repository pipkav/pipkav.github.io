## What are these classes?

**Adult + friend(s)/ Teenâ€™s + friend:* Often people are nervous to speak in a different language, meet a new person, do something difficult (like learn English!) and it can feel easier when you have a good friend at your side! In these classes with extra people we can have more conversations, games and fun; you can feel more comfortable and confident and you can save some money!
