> I attended a business English course online and the course was really useful and Pip responded to our needs and wants. Very positive about the interactive way of teaching! Pip is a very positive person with good feedback! The thing I liked most was the interactiveness and the fun we had together. -- **Kim**  

> Pip was recommended to me for my English classes and it is the best
decision I have ever made. Her classes are very practical, and she adapts
to all my needs in order to improve in the areas I need. In addition to
being a great professional, her passion for her profession and charisma
make the classes very enjoyable and fun.
I hadn't studied English for a long time, and now, in addition to having
improved the theory, I feel much more confident and very fluent in
practice. I recommend Pip 100%, she has helped me a lot in preparing for
English exams, and in having the agility I needed to hold conversations in
that language very quickly and efficiently. Thanks for your great help, the
best teacher ever. :) -- **Marta**

really looked forward to being in class with Pip.

light in her teaching style.

real playful way! - **Marjan**
